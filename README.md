# AccuTranslator
The most accurate translator in the world!

Most translators that we use today, like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator for example, will not give you 100% accurate translation results from time to time. That is when I decided to develop AccuTranslator. Its primary goal is to feature an easy-to-use user interface while giving you 100% ACCURATE translation results without having all of the unneccessary tools.

## Features
- Modern and easy-to-use User Interface
  - Some translators are hard to use with unneccessary tools that we will not need, AccuTranslator slims that down leaving it more easier than ever to translate langauges.
- Automatic Language Detection (Coming Soon)
  - Similar to Google's "Detect Language" but will be more accurate, of course.
- AI Mode (Coming Soon, May not be added due to present-day AI innaccuracies)
  - This will allow you to translate any language to another language using Artificial Intelligence.
- Offline/Downloadable Translations (Coming Soon, This will be an App-only feature)
  - Allows you to download a translation dictionary, For example: If you want to download Spanish translations, you can download all of the Spanish dictionary and translate offline.
- Voice Mode (Coming Soon)
  - This feature will allow you to talk to people normally, Just keep your phone on or anywhere that you have the app installed and everything will be translated while the person you are talking to is speaking.

## Languages Supported
- English
- Spanish (North America)
- Spanish (South America)
